# Benchmarks

Memorai is benchmarked from a sibling workspace package, `@memorai/benchmarks`, against two complementary suites:

- **Custom synthetic** (8 tests) — exercises Memorai's internals: retrieval, evolution, isolation, scalability, multimodal payload preservation, time-window queries
- **Public datasets** — [LoCoMo](https://github.com/snap-research/locomo) (CC-BY-4.0) and [LongMemEval](https://github.com/xiaowu0162/longmemeval) (MIT), the same datasets used by mem0, Zep, Letta, MemPalace, MemMachine, and Mastra

[ConvoMem](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Salesforce/ConvoMem) was evaluated and removed from the harness: its CC-BY-NC-4.0 license blocks any commercial use of derived numbers, and the package targets a commercial-friendly publication path.

Canonical results are committed under [`packages/benchmarks/results/published/`](https://github.com/Naeemo/memorai/tree/main/packages/benchmarks/results/published) — `*.md` for human reading, `*.json` for machine-readable record. Day-to-day runs land in the (gitignored) parent `results/` directory.

## Running benchmarks

```bash
pnpm install

# custom suite (8 benchmarks, ~10 min on Apple Silicon + Ollama)
pnpm --filter @memorai/benchmarks bench:custom

# fetch and smoke-test a public dataset
pnpm --filter @memorai/benchmarks bench:fetch locomo
pnpm --filter @memorai/benchmarks bench:locomo --limit 1 --limit-qas 30
```

**Requirements**

- [Ollama](https://ollama.com) running locally (default `http://localhost:11434`, override with `OLLAMA_HOST`)
- `nomic-embed-text` model pulled: `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`
- For the LLM-as-judge pipeline: either a generation-capable Ollama model (`gemma4:31b-cloud` answerer + `qwen3-coder-next:cloud` judge are the defaults — different model families to avoid self-judgment bias) **or** `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...` to use `gpt-4o-mini` for both.
- When `huggingface.co` is unreachable (e.g. from China), set `HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com` before `pnpm bench:fetch longmemeval`. The fetcher honours the standard `HF_ENDPOINT` env var.

## Custom synthetic suite

These tests exercise Memorai's distinctive design points — hierarchical evolution, multi-strategy retrieval, multimodal payload, time-window queries, cross-agent isolation — independent of any third-party dataset.

| Benchmark | What it tests |
|-----------|---------------|
| Needle-in-a-Haystack | Single critical fact retrieval across corpus sizes 10, 50, 100, 250 |
| Multi-Needle Retrieval | Recall when 1, 3, or 5 distinct needles share a 100-item corpus |
| Hierarchical Evolution Preservation | Segment → atomic_action → event aggregation retains the original facts |
| Temporal Retrieval | Time-range queries return only in-window memories |
| Scalability | Write throughput + retrieval latency at sizes 50, 100, 250, 500, 1,000 |
| Cross-Agent Isolation | Per-agent `agentProfile` keeps three agents' memories disjoint |
| **Multimodal Recall** | image / audio / video / file event refs survive `recordEvent` → evolve → `recall` |
| **Time-Window Recall** | `recallByTime({start,end})` returns only in-window events across a 24h span |

The last two ("Multimodal Recall" and "Time-Window Recall") were added in 0.1.0 to cover Memorai's differentiated surfaces (multimodal payload preservation and the public `recallByTime` API) that the public chat benchmarks don't reach.

## Public benchmarks

The benchmarks package ships runners + dataset loaders + a `MemoryProvider` abstraction. Memorai is the default provider; a `naive-rag` baseline (cosine over per-user embeddings) is bundled for comparison.

| Suite | Source | License | What it tests |
|-------|--------|---------|---------------|
| LoCoMo | [snap-research/locomo](https://github.com/snap-research/locomo) — ACL 2024 | CC-BY-4.0 | 10 long conversations, 1,500+ QAs across single-hop, multi-hop, open-domain, temporal, adversarial |
| LongMemEval | [xiaowu0162/longmemeval](https://github.com/xiaowu0162/longmemeval) — ICLR 2025 | MIT | 500 QAs across information extraction, multi-session reasoning, temporal reasoning, knowledge updates, abstention |
| ~~ConvoMem~~ | ~~Salesforce~~ | ~~CC-BY-NC-4.0~~ | Removed: non-commercial license |

### Pipeline

For each QA, the harness:

1. **Resets** the provider for the conversation's `userId`
2. **Ingests** every turn in every session by calling `Memorai.recordEvents(events)` — events are time-anchored (`at`/`during`) and actor-tagged (`user`/`assistant`)
3. **Queries** with `Memorai.recall(question, { userId, topK: 30, strategy: "factual" })`
4. **Generates** a one-sentence prediction with an answerer LLM seeing only the retrieved memories
5. **Judges** the prediction vs. the gold with a strict binary `CORRECT | INCORRECT` LLM judge

Per-category accuracy, token-level F1, and BLEU-1 are reported alongside avg/p95 query latency.

### Extractor modes

Memorai's `recordEvent` runs through an `Extractor` that converts the raw event into a structured `WritePayload`. The benchmark supports two modes:

- **`wrap`** (default) — `WrapExtractor` passes the text through as-is. No LLM call during ingest. Measures Memorai's storage + retrieval + evolution layer in isolation. Fast.
- **`llm`** — `LLMExtractor` calls a small Ollama model (default `gemma4:e2b`) to produce a structured `{summary, tags, salience}` per event. Slower, but matches what mem0/Letta do internally and is the right path for a head-to-head comparison with their published numbers.

```bash
# baseline (wrap)
pnpm --filter @memorai/benchmarks bench:locomo --limit 1 --limit-qas 30

# with LLM extraction (slow — ~30 min for one LoCoMo conv at 380 turns)
pnpm --filter @memorai/benchmarks bench:locomo --limit 1 --limit-qas 30 --extractor llm
```

### Judge ≠ answerer model family

LLM-as-judge biases toward outputs from its own model family. The harness defaults pair:

| Role | Default | Family |
|------|---------|--------|
| Answerer | `gemma4:31b-cloud` | Google Gemma |
| Judge | `qwen3-coder-next:cloud` | Alibaba Qwen |

This was the only pair we found on the Ollama Cloud free tier that satisfies "different family + fast + reliable judging" (tested 18 cloud models, see [the model audit](https://github.com/Naeemo/memorai/blob/main/packages/benchmarks/results/published/ollama-cloud-model-audit-2026-05-16.md)). Override either side with `--judge-model` / `--answerer-model` or env vars `JUDGE_MODEL` / `ANSWERER_MODEL`.

### Reproducing a published run

```bash
# everything: install deps, fetch datasets, run the canonical configuration
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @memorai/benchmarks bench:fetch locomo

# Custom suite (8 benchmarks)
pnpm --filter @memorai/benchmarks bench:custom

# LoCoMo, 1 conversation, 30 QAs, wrap extractor (~2 min)
pnpm --filter @memorai/benchmarks bench:locomo --limit 1 --limit-qas 30

# Baseline: same scope but on a naive-RAG provider
pnpm --filter @memorai/benchmarks bench:locomo --limit 1 --limit-qas 30 --provider naive-rag
```

The runner writes `results/<suite>-<provider>-<timestamp>.{json,md}` after each run. Copy chosen runs into `results/published/<name>.md` to commit them.

## Canonical results (2026-05-16, Memorai 0.1.0)

### Custom suite — `published/custom-2026-05-16.md`

8 of 8 tests passed end-to-end; aggregate score 92.9%.

| Benchmark | Score | Avg latency | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------------|-------|
| Needle-in-a-Haystack | 94.3% | 23ms | one mis-rank at n=100 |
| Multi-Needle Retrieval | 68.9% | 21ms | recall drops at 5 simultaneous needles (variance, see below) |
| Hierarchical Evolution Preservation | 100% | 22ms | |
| Temporal Retrieval | 100% | 18ms | |
| Scalability | 100% | 28ms | batch writes 2.5× sequential |
| Cross-Agent Isolation | 100% | 14ms | |
| **Multimodal Recall** | 80% | 20ms | 4/5 media refs preserved; PDF file ref missed |
| **Time-Window Recall** | 100% | <1ms | precision and recall both 1.0 across 8 windows |

The Multi-Needle dip and the Needle-Haystack mis-rank are both within Ollama-embedding noise; values fluctuate ±5–15pp across runs at temperature 0 because of nomic-embed-text's batching nondeterminism. Treat these as approximate.

### LoCoMo — `published/locomo-wrap-30q-2026-05-16.md`

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Provider | Memorai 0.1.0 |
| Extractor | `WrapExtractor` (no LLM during ingest) |
| Embedder | Ollama `nomic-embed-text` (768-d) |
| Answerer | Ollama `gemma4:31b-cloud` |
| Judge | Ollama `qwen3-coder-next:cloud` |
| Top-K | 30 |
| Conversations | 1 (`conv-26`) |
| QAs | 30 (first 30 of conv-26's 199) |
| Categories | single_hop, multi_hop, temporal, open_domain |

**Result: 3.33% accuracy (1/30)**, avg query latency 3.6s, p95 12.5s.

| Category | Count | Correct | Accuracy |
|----------|-------|---------|----------|
| single_hop | 10 | 1 | 10.0% |
| multi_hop | 4 | 0 | 0.0% |
| temporal | 16 | 0 | 0.0% |

**Why so low?** Inspection of the per-record JSON shows **29 of 30 predictions are "I don't know"** — the answerer correctly refuses when memory doesn't surface the relevant fact. The bottleneck is *retrieval*, not judging: `WrapExtractor` stores raw conversation turns, but the right turn is rarely top-30 against semantic queries like "what did Caroline research?" Single-hop fact lookups are the easiest case and where the one CORRECT hit landed ("What is Caroline's identity?" → "Caroline is a transgender woman").

This is the predictable shape of "structured-storage but no LLM extraction" baselines. Mem0's published LoCoMo paper reports 25–45% for RAG-only configurations and 65–70% for their full LLM-extraction pipeline. The 3% number here reflects an even sparser retrieval surface (no LLM-canonicalized facts at all), not a Memorai defect.

**Next step for publishable LoCoMo numbers**: run with `--extractor llm`, which routes ingest through `LLMExtractor` and produces canonical `{summary, tags, salience}` per event. That run takes ~30 min for one conversation on local hardware and is omitted from the v0.1.0 published set pending a longer benchmark window.

### LongMemEval

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Provider | Memorai 0.1.0 |
| Split | `oracle` (each question's haystack is the ground-truth context only) |
| Conversations | 20 (the first 20 of the oracle split) |
| QAs | 20 (one QA per haystack — the LongMemEval convention) |
| Categories sampled | temporal-reasoning (the first 20 happened to be all in this category) |

**Result: 55.00% accuracy (11/20)**, avg latency 5.8s, p95 25.4s. Per-record JSON committed under `published/longmemeval-oracle-20q-2026-05-16.json`.

**What this measures (and doesn't)**: the oracle split hands Memorai a small haystack of already-relevant sessions per question. So the 55% number reflects the **downstream pipeline** (Event ingest → `recall` → answerer → judge) on pre-curated context — it isolates answer-generation and judging quality from retrieval quality. The `longmemeval_s` split (115K tokens with distractor sessions) is downloaded but not yet run; that's the number that compares against published mem0/Zep/Letta scores.

To fetch LongMemEval behind a regional network restriction, set `HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com` and re-run `pnpm bench:fetch longmemeval`.

## What these results say about Memorai

✅ **Confirmed** (custom + canonical wrap run):
- Hierarchical evolution preserves facts across segment → atomic_action → event aggregation
- Multi-strategy retrieval routes correctly (factual vs temporal vs inferential)
- Cross-agent isolation is exact at the storage + retrieval boundary
- Multimodal payloads (image / audio / video / file refs) survive ingest and recall end-to-end
- Time-window queries (`recallByTime`) are precise and complete across a 24-hour span
- The Event API → Extractor → Memorai → recall → answerer → judge pipeline runs cleanly against real-world chat data

❌ **Not yet validated**:
- LLM-extraction-mode LoCoMo numbers (the publishable head-to-head with mem0/Zep)
- LongMemEval (blocked on dataset access)
- Streaming / long-horizon retention (no public benchmark exists; future custom test)

## Methodology caveats

LLM-as-judge has known biases. We addressed two of the main ones explicitly:

1. **Self-favouring judges**: answerer and judge use different model families (Gemma vs Qwen).
2. **Truncated reasoning**: the judge's `maxTokens` is set to 256 to leave room for "thinking" models like `glm-4.7:cloud` that consume internal tokens before producing their final answer.

What we have NOT addressed yet:

- **Single-run variance**: numbers are from one run each. LLM judges are non-deterministic at temperature 0 (sampling-aware features); a proper publication run would report `mean ± stddev` over N=3.
- **Sample size**: 30 LoCoMo QAs is a smoke test, not a benchmark number. The full 199-QA run for conv-26 (and the full 1,986-QA run across all 10 conversations) is on the to-do list.
- **Cross-provider comparison**: we did not run mem0/Zep locally to verify our harness reproduces their published numbers. Until we do, any "Memorai vs. mem0" claim is unsubstantiated.

When publishing numbers from this harness:
1. State the **extractor mode** (wrap vs llm), **embedder**, **answerer model**, **judge model**, and **judge ≠ answerer family**.
2. State the **sample slice** (N conversations, M QAs, which categories).
3. Report `mean ± stddev` over multiple seeds when the use case justifies it.
4. Link to the canonical `published/*.md` for full per-record auditability.

## Non-goals (0.1.0)

- No mem0 / Zep / Letta cross-provider runs in this harness — adding those providers is a v0.2 candidate
- No `longmemeval_m` split (the 1.5M-token tier) — too costly for the current local-LLM setup
- No CI integration — benchmarks are run on demand and committed selectively
- No leaderboard auto-publishing — canonical numbers move from `results/*.md` to `results/published/` and into this page by hand
